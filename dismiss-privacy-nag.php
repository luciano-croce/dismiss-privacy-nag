 * Why this plugin?
 *
 * Seem that the new privacy pointer is not "totally" auto dismissible when is clicked one of the any admin menu links, for example:
 * - If one of the any admin menu links was clicked, the privacy pointer disappear.
 * - If the dasboard admin menu link was clicked, the privacy pointer not disappear, return visible, and nagging user.
 * - The privacy pointer is misaligned to admin menu when exist other admin menu items of 3rd party -- https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43996/
 * - The suggested code to auto dismiss it seem to not working well -- remove_action( 'admin_print_footer_scripts', array( 'WP_Internal_Pointers', 'pointer_wp496_privacy' ) );
 * - The remove_action for pointer_wp496_privacy needed to be called from the admin_enqueue_scripts action with a priority of 11.
 *
 * Based to the Detailed Guidelines 11: plugins should not hijack the admin dashboard. 
 *
 * Users prefer and expect plugins to feel like part of WordPress.
 * Constant nags and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary alerts detract from this experience.
 * Upgrade prompts, notices, alerts, and the like must be limited in scope and used sparingly, be that contextually or only on the pluginâ€™s setting page.
 * Site wide notices or embedded dashboard widgets must be dismissible or self-dismiss when resolved.
 * Error messages and alerts must include information on how to resolve the situation, and remove themselves when completed.

 *
 * Privacy: Add an admin pointer for new privacy features in 4.9.6.
 *
 * The new features are very important for some users, because of their GDPR obligations.
 * They're also spread across multiple top-level menus, making them less discoverable.
 * An admin pointer will help to ensure that users are aware of the new tools and how to find them.
 *
 * Props desrosj, andreamiddleton, allendav, xkon.
 * Fixes #43942 ?
